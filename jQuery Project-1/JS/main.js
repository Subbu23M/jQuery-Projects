// jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

// Basic Syntax

// $(document).ready(function(){
//     Block of code goes here
// })

// Array of objects
